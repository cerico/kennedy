Cragg Vale - This linear walk takes you down a wooded stream where you can see remnants of the area’s rich industrial heritage.
From 10,000 years ago when Stone Age hunters were firing flint arrows to the importance of 13th Century rabbits, and 1930s chicks. You’ll see our Million Pound Churchand and we’ll show how this tranquil valley pulsed with industry, noise and smoke from 11 busy mills. We’ll bring you up to the present day with our business park made from chicken sheds – and hosting Le Tour De France.
